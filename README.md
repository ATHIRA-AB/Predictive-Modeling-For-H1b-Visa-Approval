# Predictive-Modeling-For-H1b-Visa-Approval 
python and machine learning
The goal is for predicting the outcome of the approval of H-1B visa, the 2011-2016 H-1B dataset is used which contains more than 3 million petitions from the datasets. and to find a pattern to predict the outcome by using a predictive model developed using Machine Learning techn ques. In order to predict the case status of the applicants, we will be feeding the model with the dataset which contains the required fields by which the machine can predict the certification status of the visa applications.
